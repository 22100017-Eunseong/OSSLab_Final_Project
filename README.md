# OSSLab_Final_Project
**Title:** Food and Its Rating in Handong Global University

# What does this project do? 


# Why is this project useful? 
Every year, about 800 freshmen join Handong Global University. 
However, I found out that the majority of first-year students do not know what kind of meal is available at Handong.
They can see all the types of a meal and its rating at Handong so that they can choose their meal more efficiently. They can check the food quality by checking its rating. 
Also, students can add new meals and rate them.
