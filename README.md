## What does this project do? 
This project collects data (food and its rating of Handong Global University) from users. 
<br>These collected data will be stored in files so that other users can see the whole data.

## Why is this project useful? 
Every year, about 800 freshmen join Handong Global University. However, the majority of first-year students do not know what kind of meal is available at Handong. Furthermore, there are not any ratings about the meals. 

However, this project will help people, especially students at Handong Global University. By running this program, they can see all the types of a meal and its rating to choose their meal more efficiently. 
<br>They can check the food quality by checking its rating. Also, users can add new meals and rate them. This project will be helpful for every student, especially first-year students, and it is beneficial for the future.

## Contribution
I have coded everything. Only for the updating files, I  got an idea from the internet.
I used Poping A Menu screen that I learned in C programming class. 
All other codes were provided in the OSSLab lecture.
I used three different files to store three different data to handle data more efficiently.
